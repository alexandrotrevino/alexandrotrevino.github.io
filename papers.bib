  abstract  = "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) frequently recurs even after initial complete response to therapy, due to the persistence of minimal residual disease (MRD). Here, we identified the mechanisms of persistence of residual tumor cells through single-cell spatial transcriptomic and proteomic analyses of both post-chemoembolization residual human HCC and transgenic mouse models of MRD. We defined the spatial organization of residual human HCC into neighborhoods within which EpCAM+/CK19+ stem-like tumor cells interact with PDL1+ M2-like macrophages. This was associated with PD1+/TIM3+ CD8T cell exhaustion and poor recurrence-free survival. Then, through spatially resolved transcriptomic analysis, we identified macrophage-mediated TGFβ1 pathway activation as a mediator of persistence of residual tumor cells. Through a mouse model of MRD, we demonstrated that Tgfβr1+ residual stem-like tumor cells survive in Tgfβ1+/Pdl1+ macrophage-rich niches which enforce CD8T cell exhaustion and enable tumor recurrence. Finally, in two mouse models: a transgenic mouse model of MRD and a syngeneic orthotopic allograft model of doxorubicin-resistant HCC, we found that the combined blockade of Tgfβ and Pdl1 pathways excluded immunosuppressive macrophages, thereby recruiting activated CD8T cells that eliminate residual tumor cells. Thus, through spatial mapping, we have identified the mechanistic roles of the TGFβ and PDL1 pathways in persistence of residual tumor cells in human HCC. Targeting these pathways holds therapeutic potential to eliminate MRD, which could reduce recurrence and improve patient outcomes.",

               cause of chronic and end-stage kidney disease in the USA and
               worldwide. Animal models have taught us much about DKD
               mechanisms, but translation of this knowledge into treatments
               for human disease has been slowed by the lag in our molecular
               understanding of human DKD. METHODS: Using our Spatial TissuE
               Proteomics (STEP) pipeline (comprising curated human kidney
               tissues, multiplexed immunofluorescence and powerful analysis
               tools), we imaged and analysed the expression of 21 proteins in
               23 tissue sections from individuals with diabetes and healthy
               kidneys (n=5), compared to those with DKDIIA, IIA-B and IIB (n=2
               each) and DKDIII (n=1). RESULTS: These analyses revealed the
               existence of 11 cellular clusters (kidney compartments/cell
               types): podocytes, glomerular endothelial cells, proximal
               tubules, distal nephron, peritubular capillaries, blood vessels
               (endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells),
               macrophages, myeloid cells, other CD45+ inflammatory cells,
               basement membrane and the interstitium. DKD progression was
               associated with co-localised increases in inflammatory cells and
               collagen IV deposition, with concomitant loss of native proteins
               of each nephron segment. Cell-type frequency and neighbourhood
               analyses highlighted a significant increase in inflammatory
               cells and their adjacency to tubular and $\alpha$SMA+
               ($\alpha$-smooth muscle actin-positive) cells in DKD. Finally,
               DKD progression showed marked regional variability within single
               tissue sections, as well as inter-individual variability within
               each DKD class. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Using the STEP
               pipeline, we found alterations in protein expression, cellular
               phenotypic composition and microenvironment structure with DKD
               progression, demonstrating the power of this pipeline to reveal

  abstract  = "Solid tumours are innervated by nerve fibres that arise from the
               autonomic and sensory peripheral nervous systems1-5. Whether the
               neo-innervation of tumours by pain-initiating sensory neurons
               affects cancer immunosurveillance remains unclear. Here we show
               that melanoma cells interact with nociceptor neurons, leading to
               increases in their neurite outgrowth, responsiveness to noxious
               ligands and neuropeptide release. Calcitonin gene-related
               peptide (CGRP)-one such nociceptor-produced
               neuropeptide-directly increases the exhaustion of cytotoxic CD8+
               T cells, which limits their capacity to eliminate melanoma.
               Genetic ablation of the TRPV1 lineage, local pharmacological
               silencing of nociceptors and antagonism of the CGRP receptor
               RAMP1 all reduced the exhaustion of tumour-infiltrating
               leukocytes and decreased the growth of tumours, nearly tripling
               the survival rate of mice that were inoculated with B16F10
               melanoma cells. Conversely, CD8+ T cell exhaustion was rescued
               in sensory-neuron-depleted mice that were treated with local
               recombinant CGRP. As compared with wild-type CD8+ T cells,
               Ramp1-/- CD8+ T cells were protected against exhaustion when
               co-transplanted into tumour-bearing Rag1-deficient mice.
               Single-cell RNA sequencing of biopsies from patients with
               melanoma revealed that intratumoral RAMP1-expressing CD8+ T
               cells were more exhausted than their RAMP1-negative
               counterparts, whereas overexpression of RAMP1 correlated with a
               poorer clinical prognosis. Overall, our results suggest that
               reducing the release of CGRP from tumour-innervating nociceptors
               could be a strategy to improve anti-tumour immunity by
               eliminating the immunomodulatory effects of CGRP on cytotoxic
               CD8+ T cells.",

               both independently and jointly. This revealed waves of gene

               continuous differentiation trajectory, distinguished the

               lineage-determining TFs that exhibited strong correlation
               between linked gene-regulatory elements and expression levels.
               These highly connected genes adopted an active chromatin state

              high fidelity in eukaryotic cells, Cas9n can be leveraged to
              mediate highly specific genome editing, either via nonhomologous

               for RNA-guided genome editing and transcription regulation in
               eukaryotic cells, yet their in vivo target specificity is poorly
               understood. Here we mapped genome-wide binding sites of a
               catalytically inactive Cas9 (dCas9) from Streptococcus pyogenes
               loaded with single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) in mouse embryonic stem
               cells (mESCs). Each of the four sgRNAs we tested targets dCas9
               to between tens and thousands of genomic sites, frequently
               characterized by a 5-nucleotide seed region in the sgRNA and an
               NGG protospacer adjacent motif (PAM). Chromatin inaccessibility
               decreases dCas9 binding to other sites with matching seed
               sequences; thus 70\% of off-target sites are associated with
               genes. Targeted sequencing of 295 dCas9 binding sites in mESCs
               transfected with catalytically active Cas9 identified only one
               site mutated above background levels. We propose a two-state
               model for Cas9 binding and cleavage, in which a seed match
               triggers binding but extensive pairing with target DNA is
               required for cleavage.",

               of research and medical applications. The Cas9 nuclease from the
               microbial CRISPR-Cas system is targeted to specific genomic loci
               by a 20 nt guide sequence, which can tolerate certain mismatches
               to the DNA target and thereby promote undesired off-target
               mutagenesis. Here, we describe an approach that combines a Cas9
               nickase mutant with paired guide RNAs to introduce targeted
               double-strand breaks. Because individual nicks in the genome are
               repaired with high fidelity, simultaneous nicking via
               appropriately offset guide RNAs is required for double-stranded
               breaks and extends the number of specifically recognized bases
               for target cleavage. We demonstrate that using paired nicking
               can reduce off-target activity by 50- to 1,500-fold in cell
               lines and to facilitate gene knockout in mouse zygotes without
               sacrificing on-target cleavage efficiency. This versatile

               organismal processes therefore necessitates approaches that
               enable spatially and temporally precise modulation of gene
               expression. Recently, a variety of microbial and plant-derived
               light-sensitive proteins have been engineered as optogenetic
               actuators, enabling high-precision spatiotemporal control of
               many cellular functions. However, versatile and robust
               technologies that enable optical modulation of transcription in
               the mammalian endogenous genome remain elusive. Here we describe
               the development of light-inducible transcriptional effectors
               (LITEs), an optogenetic two-hybrid system integrating the
               customizable TALE DNA-binding domain with the light-sensitive
               cryptochrome 2 protein and its interacting partner CIB1 from
               Arabidopsis thaliana. LITEs do not require additional exogenous
               chemical cofactors, are easily customized to target many
               endogenous genomic loci, and can be activated within minutes
               with reversibility. LITEs can be packaged into viral vectors and
               genetically targeted to probe specific cell populations. We have
               applied this system in primary mouse neurons, as well as in the
               brain of freely behaving mice in vivo to mediate reversible
               modulation of mammalian endogenous gene expression as well as
               targeted epigenetic chromatin modifications. The LITE system
               establishes a novel mode of optogenetic control of endogenous
               cellular processes and enables direct testing of the causal
