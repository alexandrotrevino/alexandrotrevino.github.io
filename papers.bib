	abstract = {Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) frequently recurs from minimal residual disease (MRD), which persists after therapy. Here, we identified mechanisms of persistence of residual tumor cells using post-chemoembolization human HCC (n = 108 patients, 1.07 million cells) and a transgenic mouse model of MRD. Through single-cell high-plex cytometric imaging, we identified a spatial neighborhood within which PD-L1 + M2-like macrophages interact with stem-like tumor cells, correlating with CD8+ T cell exhaustion and poor survival. Further, through spatial transcriptomics of residual HCC, we showed that macrophage-derived TGFβ1 mediates the persistence of stem-like tumor cells. Last, we demonstrate that combined blockade of Pdl1 and Tgfβ excluded immunosuppressive macrophages, recruited activated CD8+ T cells and eliminated residual stem-like tumor cells in two mouse models: a transgenic model of MRD and a syngeneic orthotopic model of doxorubicin-resistant HCC. Thus, our spatial analyses reveal that PD-L1+ macrophages sustain MRD by activating the TGFβ pathway in stem-like cancer cells and targeting this interaction may prevent HCC recurrence from MRD.},

               cause of chronic and end-stage kidney disease in the USA and
               worldwide. Animal models have taught us much about DKD
               mechanisms, but translation of this knowledge into treatments
               for human disease has been slowed by the lag in our molecular
               understanding of human DKD. METHODS: Using our Spatial TissuE
               Proteomics (STEP) pipeline (comprising curated human kidney
               tissues, multiplexed immunofluorescence and powerful analysis
               tools), we imaged and analysed the expression of 21 proteins in
               23 tissue sections from individuals with diabetes and healthy
               kidneys (n=5), compared to those with DKDIIA, IIA-B and IIB (n=2
               each) and DKDIII (n=1). RESULTS: These analyses revealed the
               existence of 11 cellular clusters (kidney compartments/cell
               types): podocytes, glomerular endothelial cells, proximal
               tubules, distal nephron, peritubular capillaries, blood vessels
               (endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells),
               macrophages, myeloid cells, other CD45+ inflammatory cells,
               basement membrane and the interstitium. DKD progression was
               associated with co-localised increases in inflammatory cells and
               collagen IV deposition, with concomitant loss of native proteins
               of each nephron segment. Cell-type frequency and neighbourhood
               analyses highlighted a significant increase in inflammatory
               cells and their adjacency to tubular and $\alpha$SMA+
               ($\alpha$-smooth muscle actin-positive) cells in DKD. Finally,
               DKD progression showed marked regional variability within single
               tissue sections, as well as inter-individual variability within
               each DKD class. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Using the STEP

               phenotypic composition and microenvironment structure with DKD

While several image search methods have been introduced for conventional images and digital pathology, mIF images present three main challenges: (1) high dimension-ality, (2) domain-specificity, and (3) complex additional molecular information. To address this gap, we introduce the MIISS framework, a Multi-granularity mIF Image Similarity Search pipeline that employs self-supervised learning models to extract features from mIF image patches and an entropy-based aggregation method to enable similarity searches at higher, multi-granular levels. We then benchmarked various feature generation approaches to handle high dimensional images and tested them on various foundation models. We conducted evaluations using datasets from different tissues on both patch- and patient-level, which demonstrate the frame-work{\textquoteright}s effectiveness and generalizability. Notably, we found that domain-specific models consistently outperformed other models, further showing their robustness and generalizability across different datasets. The MIISS framework offers an effective solution for navigating the growing landscape of mIF images, providing tangible clinical benefits and opening new avenues for pathology research.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

               neo-innervation of tumours by pain-initiating sensory neurons
               affects cancer immunosurveillance remains unclear. Here we show
               that melanoma cells interact with nociceptor neurons, leading to
               increases in their neurite outgrowth, responsiveness to noxious
               ligands and neuropeptide release. Calcitonin gene-related
               peptide (CGRP)-one such nociceptor-produced
               neuropeptide-directly increases the exhaustion of cytotoxic CD8+
               T cells, which limits their capacity to eliminate melanoma.
               Genetic ablation of the TRPV1 lineage, local pharmacological
               silencing of nociceptors and antagonism of the CGRP receptor
               RAMP1 all reduced the exhaustion of tumour-infiltrating
               leukocytes and decreased the growth of tumours, nearly tripling
               the survival rate of mice that were inoculated with B16F10
               melanoma cells. Conversely, CD8+ T cell exhaustion was rescued
               in sensory-neuron-depleted mice that were treated with local
               recombinant CGRP. As compared with wild-type CD8+ T cells,
               Ramp1-/- CD8+ T cells were protected against exhaustion when
               co-transplanted into tumour-bearing Rag1-deficient mice.
               Single-cell RNA sequencing of biopsies from patients with
               melanoma revealed that intratumoral RAMP1-expressing CD8+ T
               cells were more exhausted than their RAMP1-negative
               counterparts, whereas overexpression of RAMP1 correlated with a
               poorer clinical prognosis. Overall, our results suggest that
               reducing the release of CGRP from tumour-innervating nociceptors
               could be a strategy to improve anti-tumour immunity by
               eliminating the immunomodulatory effects of CGRP on cytotoxic
               CD8+ T cells.",

               between linked gene-regulatory elements and expression levels.
               These highly connected genes adopted an active chromatin state

               loaded with single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) in mouse embryonic stem

               decreases dCas9 binding to other sites with matching seed
               sequences; thus 70\% of off-target sites are associated with

               by a 20 nt guide sequence, which can tolerate certain mismatches

               breaks and extends the number of specifically recognized bases
               for target cleavage. We demonstrate that using paired nicking
               can reduce off-target activity by 50- to 1,500-fold in cell
               lines and to facilitate gene knockout in mouse zygotes without

               technologies that enable optical modulation of transcription in

               the development of light-inducible transcriptional effectors
               (LITEs), an optogenetic two-hybrid system integrating the
               customizable TALE DNA-binding domain with the light-sensitive
               cryptochrome 2 protein and its interacting partner CIB1 from
