# The Genome is a Physical Object

Genomes are structured and dynamic macromolecules subject to physical constraints - and to the surprising forces exerted by the central dogma. Processes like replication and transcription have physical consequences, and it is likely that they in turn are informed by physical factors. I am interested in **untangling the relationship between genomes and the forces that act on them**, which could entail:

1. creating new methods to measure physical properties like torsional strain;
2. designing synthetic systems, endogenous perturbations, or natural experiments to test physically-motivated hypotheses
3. incorporating physical properties into fundamental computational models of life

# All life is life

The vast majority of research focuses on a few common animal models, in vitro cell lines, and human biology (especially within a narrow set of disease contexts or pathogens). While our knowledge of cell and molecular biology in those systems have exploded, many key conclusions still lack comparative or evolutionary perspective. **I imagine that the future of biology research is enriched by findings from across the tree of life.** To get there could entail:

1. applying proven experimental methods towards comparative studies
2. curiousity-driven research on non-model organisms and ecosystems

### Curiosity First
follow the rabbit holes -- take risks -- no fear
### Active Bias
hypothesis-driven -- synthetic design -- get hands dirty
### More to Learn
ask stupid questions -- accumulate 'negative' results -- eyes open!
