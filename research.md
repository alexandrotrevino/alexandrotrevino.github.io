During development, cells must contend with the physical forces exerted by replication and transcription to successfully differentiate. Interpreting genetic and genomic data thus requires an understanding of DNA as a tangible, dynamic object with concrete physical properties. 

I am interested how these properties connect to the development and evolution of cell states, especially in the human nervous system. I study genome architecture, gene composition, and physical genomic forces towards building a complete model of mammalian gene regulation.

My research experience spans topics in gene regulation, neuroscience, and drug development. Prior to graduate school, I helped to design and test landmark transcriptome and epigenome engineering tools in mammals, enabling optical control and genome-scale screening. During my Ph.D., I studied the development of the human cerebral cortex and explored general physical rules that govern gene regulation. Finally, I transitioned to a role at a startup biotechnology company, where I established and led a machine learning R&D group that has made substantial published contributions to topics in spatial biology data analysis.

\- __Curiosity First:__&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;follow rabbit holes -- take risks -- try new ideas -- leave time to think
\- __Active Bias:__&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be hands-on when learning -- design hypothesis-driven experiments
\- __More to Learn:__&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ask questions -- question results -- good experiments are more important than good results
\- __Collectivism:__&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;share opportunity -- lift others up -- promote flourishing
