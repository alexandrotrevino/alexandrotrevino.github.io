The genome is often thought of as the blueprint of an organism. Unlike blueprints, however, genomes are actively reorganized and modified according to their use. During development, cells must contend with the physical forces exerted by replication and transcription to successfully differentiate. Interpreting genetic and genomic data thus requires an understanding of DNA as a tangible, dynamic object with concrete physical properties.

I am interested how these properties connect to the development and evolution of cell states, including the logic of human genome architecture, the impacts of DNA torsion and other forces on gene regulation, and how physical mechanisms operate across space and time during development.

My past research experience spans topics in gene regulation, neuroscience, and drug development, and is characterized by leadership of collaborative, interdisciplinary projects. Prior to graduate school, I helped to design and test landmark transcriptome and epigenome engineering tools in mammals, enabling optical control and genome-scale screening. During my Ph.D., I shifted my focus from engineering gene regulation to quantifying gene regulation. I was motivated by two aims: First, to understand the logic behind building the human brain, which is singular in nature for its capacity to support awareness and culture; and second, to identify general rules that govern gene regulation during cell development. Finally, I transitioned to a role at a startup biotechnology company, where I established and led a machine learning R&D group that has made substantial published contributions to topics in spatial biology data analysis.
