# The Genome is a Physical Object

A, T, C, G: the 'letters' of the genetic code. The recently acquired ability to analyze entire genomes computationally tends to produce a disconnect between the fact of DNA and its abstractions. Real genomes are structured macromolecules that bend, twist, and organize subject to physical constraints - and to the surprising forces applied by the central dogma. DNA storage, replication, and transcription processes all have physical consequences, and are in turn informed by physical factors. Start with the packaging problem: Stretched end-to-end, the human genome measures 2 meters in length, yet packs into a nucleus less than 10 millionths of a meter in diameter. Or the phenomenon of supercoiling - how does the degree of torsion built up in genomes or topological domains affect gene regulation? I am interested in **untangling the relationship between genomes and the forces that act on them**.  

# There Are No Single Cells

The advent of single-cell genomics has been transformative for building more complete records of biological variation between cells, particularly at the level of messenger RNA production but also in other views. No biological measurement is perfect, but these snapshots miss
