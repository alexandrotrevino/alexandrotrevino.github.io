## Author's Summary
In this study, we profiled chromatin accessibility (with ATAC-seq) and mRNA transcripts in ultra-long-term 3D neural organoid cultures. We were taken aback by how closely these models resembled matched developmental time points from human primary tissue, including a complex wave of gene regulation in dorsal cortical organoids corresponding to excitatory neurogenesis between 12-20 post conceptional weeks (PCW); gliogenesis in both dorsal and ventral spheroids; and an abrupt regulatory shift after ~250 days in culture characterized by glial maturation signatures. With paired RNA and accessibility data, we nominated key transcription factors likely to drive developmental transitions. Finally, our data enabled us to pinpoint the developmental timing and cell specificity of disease-associated genetic variants, as well as gene sets associated with autism spectrum disorders.  

## Abstract

Forebrain development is characterized by highly synchronized cellular processes, which, if perturbed, can cause disease. To chart the regulatory activity underlying these events, we generated a map of accessible chromatin in human three-dimensional forebrain organoids. To capture corticogenesis, we sampled glial and neuronal lineages from dorsal or ventral forebrain organoids over 20 months in vitro. Active chromatin regions identified in human primary brain tissue were observed in organoids at different developmental stages. We used this resource to map genetic risk for disease and to explore evolutionary conservation. Moreover, we integrated chromatin accessibility with transcriptomics to identify putative enhancer-gene linkages and transcription factors that regulate human corticogenesis. Overall, this platform brings insights into gene-regulatory dynamics at previously inaccessible stages of human forebrain development, including signatures of neuropsychiatric disorders.
