I study the genomic control of development with a particular interest in the physical forces governing gene regulation across life.

My career spans topics in gene regulation, brain development, and cancer biology. As a researcher, mentor, and group leader, I am dedicated to connecting and motivating technical experts across disciplines, building bridges between laboratory and computational biology; academia and industry; science and engineering. 

Currently I am Head of Research at [**Enable Medicine**](https://enablemedicine.com), a tech-bio company. I also co-own **Biographi**, a boutique consulting firm that connects companies and investors to biological expertise. 

I am led by curiousity and wonder in personal as well as professional life. My [projects](./projects/) and pastimes include making music and musical instruments, reading, and (soon) fatherhood. I live in Lexington, KY with my wife Blaize and our dog Oso. Fluent in Spanish and English.
