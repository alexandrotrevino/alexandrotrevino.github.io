I study the genomic control of development, with a particular focus on the fundamental physical forces that govern gene regulation.

My career spans topics in gene regulation, brain development, and cancer biology. Currently I am Head of Research at [**Enable Medicine**](https://enablemedicine.com), a tech-bio company. I also co-own **Biographi**, a boutique consulting firm that connects companies and investors to biological expertise. I completed my Ph.D. from Stanford in the labs of William Greenleaf and Howard Chang, mentored additionally by Sergiu Pa»ôca. As a group leader and mentor, I am dedicated to connecting and motivating technical experts across disciplines and reaching across silos to expand accessibility and opportunity in STEM.

I am led by curiousity and wonder in personal as well as professional life. My [projects](./projects/) and pastimes include making music and musical instruments, reading, and (soon) fatherhood. I live in Lexington, KY with my wife Blaize and our dog Oso. Fluent in Spanish and English.
